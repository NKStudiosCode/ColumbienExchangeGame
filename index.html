     Living in the 21st century, seeing a cigarette is far from uncommon. But what is in that cigarette is tobacco, a plant that has a rich history stretching back 8,000 years. In 1492 tobacco began to be traded in the Columbian exchange and it flooded the market of consumers: everyone wanted to buy it. People moved to the Americas just to grow tobacco and become rich selling it to the Europeans through the Columbian exchange. It became the first global commodity and controlled the economy, affecting the power of nations. To the people trading it in the Columbian exchange it was a glorious medicine that everyone needed. To this day it kills millions and addicts millions more each year. All of this makes tobacco one of the most important commodities in human history. Tobacco, also known as nicotiana genus, a close relative of an extremely deadly nightshade used in poisons, was surprisingly known for itś health properties in the mid 16th century. According to the article ”Where Does Tobacco Come From”, ”[Tobacco] gained instant popularity in Europe, for they believed that tobacco had magical healing powers. Soon, the smoking of tobacco was promoted as a viable way to get your “daily dose of tobacco.”” This basically means everyone was hooked on tobacco, they liked it and they thought it was good for them, so everyone was using it to help their health. In other words it was the equivalent of medicine in the 21 century, except all its supposed positive effects were wrong. Seeing how medicine is very important today, that puts a different perspective on tobacco back then. In addition the article ”Tobacco: The Early History of a New World Crop'' says, “However, it was perceived, by the end of the seventeenth century tobacco had become the economic staple of Virginia, easily making her the wealthiest of the 13 colonies by the time of the American Revolution.” This basically meant that tobacco was a major part of the economy because it could control the power of states and probably also nations. This is all very important but a true demonstration of tobacco's value is that it still affects us today, 8,000 years later. Each year millions of people die because of smoking tobacco and millions more get addicted. The article ”Where Does Tobacco Come From” says ”Still, tobacco companies make billions of dollars in revenue every year, destroying the health of others. It’s estimated that there are around 1 billion tobacco users in the world today. The damage caused by this addiction and its peddlers numbers in trillions of dollars of health expenses and environmental damages and more effort has to be made to educate people, especially teenagers and young adults, about the dangers of smoking.” ”This illustrates the point of how smoking has such a big impact because even 8,000 years after tobacco's invention it’s still affecting the world in a huge way, costing us trillions of dollars for our health, addicting billions and killing millions. There is no arguing that tobacco was one of the most important commodities both then and now. Back 500 years ago it was considered medicine and changed the balance of power in the world, today it’s the curse on humanity, stealing money and lives, but nevertheless, it’s over 8,000 year lifetime that's full of huge events undeniably proves that it’s one of the most important commodities the world has ever seen.
